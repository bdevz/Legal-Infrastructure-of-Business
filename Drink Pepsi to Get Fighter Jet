Was the headline exciting for you to click? Advertisement in this age has to grab attention like my headline just proved. But, does the ad you just saw on the streaming platform constitute an offer? That was the central question in the case of John Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc.

Before we proceed, I would like you to watch the ad and then read the blog.

It is an excellent ad by famous BBDO, Pepsi at the time of making an ad was amidst cola-wars, and this ad was their trump card. They spent over $125 Million in merchandise and possibly more for the entire campaign.

Now, put on your Legal Infrastructure of Business hat, Does this advertisement has something that concerns you? Well, you are not alone.

Enter John Leonard, who believed Harrier jet at the end of the commercial was a legitimate offer. At 7 million Pepsi points, John Leonard would have taken more than 100 years to accumulate those points (provided he drinks 10-can-a-day). However, John wanted the Jet. Jonh called Pepsi and found out that he could buy Pepsi points for 10 cents each.

He then approached other individual investors to pool up 700,000, and he mailed 15 Pepsi points along with a check of 700,000 and asked Pepsi to hold their advertised offer. Things did not go as planned, Pepsi denied stating - the Jet was not included in their catalog and "The Harrier jet in the Pepsi commercial is fanciful and is simply included to create a humorous and entertaining ad."

Leonard then took Pepsi to court. Pepsi filed in NY court to obtain a declaratory judgment stating that it was not obligated to transfer a Harrier Jet to Leonard.

Finally, after three years of battle, Judge Kimba Wood of NY's Southern District Court declared in favor of Pepsi, stating four significant points.

Ad as an offer –As per Restatement (Second) of Contracts, the general rule is that an advertisement does not constitute an offer.
Ads are also not considered contract law – They are merely the requests to "offer or negotiate."
The ad was a joke – An "ordinary, reasonable person" would conclude that a soft drink company would not give away a fighter plane as part of a promotion. (Graves v. Northern N.Y. Pub. Co.,)
An enforceable contract would require a signature from Both parties - Under existing law, an agreement for the sale of goods worth $500+ must be evidenced by writing; Pepsi did not sign anything.

Pepsi won here, but there are numerous other cases where businesses often do not get away with lofty ads. For example, Red Bull did not; Red Bull's "gives you wings" has been ad which the company still uses, had to pay out 13 Million after settling a class-action lawsuit that accused red bull of making false and misleading advertising claims.  

I was surprised to learn that Pepsi Won and Red Bull settled. What do you think? As future marketers, entrepreneurs, and executives, how do you determine the extent of advertisement and contractual law?
